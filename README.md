Halfcoin is a technical coin that can be mined on the CPU of your laptop
========================================================================

For mining you can get client for Windows here: https://github.com/merecoin/halfcoin/releases or just compile the source code.

Halfcoin is the basis for a new type of cryptocurrency exchange.
----------------------------------------------------------------

The fact is that when I created Merecoin, I was asked:

- And where it can be changed to Bitcoin or other coins?

And I tried to place Merecoin on stock exchanges. But on large exchanges require a lot of money to place your coin. They want 2 or even 4 BTC. Or that your coin was very popular. But the coin will not become popular if it is not on the stock exchange. It's a vicious circle.

And I decided to break this vicious circle. Create a new type of exchange. Based on one of the open source engines. And for the technical needs of the exchange, you need an internal crypto currency. So there was Halfcoin.

At first I planned to premine half of the coins (that's why "Half-"). But then I counted and decided that the premine should be even more. To modify the code of the exchange and launch on the server, bitcoins are needed. Therefore, if you have bitcoins and you want to take part in the creation of the exchange - you can change your bitcoins to halfcoins at a very favorable rate. Contact me please.

The initial launch of the new exchange requires 2-3 months and 10 BTC. For it you will receive 10,000,000 halfcoins. That is 1,000,000 HALF = 1 BTC. The minimum amount for the exchange is 0.05 BTC.
